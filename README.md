# Web Application Firewall (WAF) Home Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Web Application Firewall (WAF) home lab** to simulate real-world web application attacks and evaluate defensive controls.  
The lab uses a vulnerable web application as the backend and a WAF deployed as a **reverse proxy with TLS termination**, allowing controlled attack simulation and traffic inspection.

The primary goal of this lab is to gain hands-on experience with:
- Reverse proxy architectures
- TLS/SSL termination
- Web attack patterns
- WAF detection and mitigation
- Network segmentation in virtualized environments
